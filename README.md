# Spreadsheet-Based Options Pricing Calculator with Greeks
This was implemented with LibreOffice's Calc (calc is short for calculator, hence the repo name) as a tool to determine European-style call and put option prices and greeks using the Black-Scholes-Merton model[1].
The model applies to some European-style non-collateralized cash-settled structured call and put warrants which are listed on Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities").
